# Portable-Mini-Billboard-and-Patent-Application
In the real-estate and event marketing worlds, it is advantageous to have portable signage that is compact for transport, and simple to setup without tools. This research explores such a concept, and presents the associated patent application along with images of the product in use. 

## Objective
Real estate agents and event marketers utilize signage on a regular basis; however, transporting traditional signs often results in vehicle interior damage and wear on clothing. Furthermore, vehicle cargo constraints often limit the number of signs transportable in a single trip, necessitating multiple trips or the use of third-party logistics. It is therefore necessary to design a signage system that is foldable, compact, and self-contained. A key innovation of this design is the integration of the frame as a post-hole driver, utilizing the mass of the frame itself to insert and remove the supporting stake, thereby eliminating the need for external tools.

## Theoretical foundations and Product Requirements
To fully optimize the design of portable signage, the following requirements must be met:

* Compact for storage and transport: To be viable for major events, 20 signs must fit within the trunk of a standard vehicle. This requires high volumetric efficiency and nesting geometry.
* Easy and quick to set up: An average person must be able to set up a sign in under three minutes without prior training.
* No additional tools: The system must be self-contained. An internal stake is extended, and the mass of the frame is used as a slide-hammer post driver to both insert and remove the stake.
* High wind resistance: The sign must withstand wind bursts of up to 80 mph. This stability is achieved through pivoting arms that reduce cross-sectional area to the wind load.
